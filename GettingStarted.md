A quick guide to using the matlab code

# Introduction #

The matlab code is used to realize the example in Section4.1 of paper"Concurrent treatment of parametric uncertainty and meta-modeling uncertainty in robust design"



# How to use the code #

Firstly, download the DACE Toolbox and add it to the path of matlab
Secondly, execution the codes in Matlab
